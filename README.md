# Fanur-Technology-Website
This is a fully responsive portfolio website. I used html, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery to make it. While working on my website, I thought carefully about Keeping my design balanced. I used grids, flex boxes and picked a couple of good base colors to keep my website consistent and professional. I made the graphics go well together and used appropriate typography. I made the elements stand out by adding white space around them. All elements are nicely connected together and fully functional.
